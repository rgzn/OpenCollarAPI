    # OpenAPI Specification 
    
    This API is documented in **OpenAPI format**.
    Documentation html is generated with 
    [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo) and 
    [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc)
    
    # OpenCollarAPI 
    
    This is a proposed universal standard API for GPS collar data access. 
    This API specification details the minimum set of calls required to meet the
    universal open standard. Collar data providers may provide more calls to
    meet their needs so long as they implement the API detailed in this
    standard. Additional calls should still be in the Open API format. 
    You can find out more about OpenAPI at [http://swagger.io](http://swagger.io) 
    
    # Authentication 
    
    OpenCollarAPI offers two main forms of authentication:
      - API Key
      - basicAuth and cookieAuth
      The latter option is actually two forms of authentication used in conjunction. 
      The client first authenticates with a username and password using the 
      user/login path. The response to a successful request on this path is a cookie
      with an authentication key. Then the user can submit that key via cookie
      as authentication on subsequent requests.

      These operations are for accessing information on the user's devices. This
      includes Collars, other GPS tags, VITs, or any other devices that push
      data to the server.

    description: |-
      These operations are for accessing position data from GPS devices. They
      are split up based on the how the data is selected, and the format of the
      returned data. Some of the calls in this sections return CSV files instead
      of JSON responses. The format for the CSV is specified in the external
      documentation.
