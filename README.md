# OpenCollarAPI

Specifications and documentation for a universal standard API to access GPS collar data. 

The main document in this project is the OpenCollarAPI yaml file. 
This specifies the API calls and responses according to the OpenAPI 3.0  standard as documented here:
https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification

To inspect the API or generate example clients/servers, try using Swagger tools. I recommend pasting the yaml text into the swagger editor here:
