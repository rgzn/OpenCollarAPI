# OpenCollarAPI

Specifications and documentation for a universal standard API to access GPS collar data. 

The main document in this project is the OpenCollarAPI yaml file. 
This specifies the API calls and responses according to the OpenAPI 3.0  standard as documented here:
https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification

To inspect the API or generate example clients/servers, try using Swagger tools. I recommend pasting the yaml text into the swagger editor here:

## About the OpenAPI standard ##

OpenAPI is the most popular standard for API documentation, specification, and generation. OpenAPI provides a format for precisely specifying all inputs and outputs of a http/s API. An API is specified using a yaml-formatted text file. From this text file, automated tools can generate the API servers, clients, and documentation. 


## About the OpenCollar API ##
This specification details the web requests and responses for a universal API for GPS tag data access. It specifies exactly the web requests and responses needed for clients to access the data generated by their GPS collars, tags, and associated devices. The API is designed around the data and functions common to all manufacturers, but is extendable to allow for individual manufacturers to add their own unique functions when needed. 

## What is specified by this standard? ##
Essentially every aspect of the interface between client and server is specified. 
This includes: 
  + Authentication process (multiple options provided)
  + Requests for information on GPS devices
  + Requests for data from GPS devices
  + Input parameters and data for all requests
  + Output response content and type

## What is not specified by this standard? ##
This standard specifies essentially nothing about the implementation details of the interface. 
Things *NOT* specified include:
  + Server software
  + Serverside database 
  + Client software
  + Additional functions. More paths may be added than are specified here. This standard just specifies a minimum set.
